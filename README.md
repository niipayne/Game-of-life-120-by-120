**TO RUN:**
- In the terminal, type javac *.java
- Type java Sim375.java 100 R

The integer after the file is the number of iterations to want to do and the letter is the configuration.

**R** - Random

**T** - Tumbler

**L** - Glider

If done correctly this should be what it looks like for the random configuration.
